Problem Statement: There is a local gaming studio in town - 'Delta Games'. They want to develop an e-commerce app where they can sell their products.

They have introduced a unique service that allows customers to rent games on an hourly basis. Charges start from Rs.100 for 5 hours and increase based on demand. A fixed refundable deposit of Rs.500, per game, is charged. Users have to select how many hours they wish to keep the game and when they want the game using the easy delivery and pick up service.
