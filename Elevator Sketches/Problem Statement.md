## Problem Statement:

Sketch out different User Interfaces for an Elevator with 1200 Floors. 

### Elevator Constraints:
#### 1. Elevators should know beforehand where a particular user needs to get on and off.
Explanation: Because the elevator knows when it is going to pick someone up and drop someone off, issues regarding scheduling elevator rides and capacity will be solved.
#### 2. Elevator should display capacity and when the next one will be available if it is full.
Explanation: This is a necessary feature because the elevators won’t be overbooked and will allow users to bring along their peers with them in the elevator ride.
#### 3. Device used to ‘book’ elevator rides should show which elevator would reach the desired floor at the earliest.
Explanation: This is required so as to provide efficiency to its users by dropping them off on desired floors quickly. This time can be calculated by what direction a particular elevator is going in and what its next floors are.
